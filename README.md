# pymaceuticals_project

Project conducted for the GWU bootcamp practice statistical analysis concepts in python. The overall project was setup to mimic an analysis that is conducted in a pharmaceutical company. Overall a interesting concept and the first time for me to really dig into statistical analysis with python.

Jupiter Notebooks is used to run the code and visualize the results.

The libraries used are: mathplotlib, pandas, scipy and functools.

The logic in the file follows:
Imports
Importing all libraries etc.

Data prep
Prepping the data the two datasets were merged and the data was cleaned.

Summery Statistics
Using groupby to extract the statistical variable (like mean/std etc).

Pie/Bar charts
Generated bar and pie charts with pyplot and pandas to dig into the data.

Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots
Section where 4 drug regimens were analysed and the quartiles etc were extracted.

Line and Scatter plot
These were done on the statistical data.

Correlation and regression
Perfomed a regression analysis on one drug in the dataset.

#observations
#1. For the treament of mouse r944 with Capomulin the treament seemed to have effect as the size of the tumor decresed.
#2. The drug Ramicane showed the best results on limitig the growth of the tumor.
#3. The drug Infubinol performed worst in the tests.

Overall a very interesting exercise. I also found I could use this right away for my job at DSV to use the exact same principles to analyse ocean freight carrier performance on contract lanes.
